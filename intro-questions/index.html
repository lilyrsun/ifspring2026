        <ol>
            <li><strong>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc). </strong>
                <ul type = "a">
                    <li>Name: Lily Sun</li>
                    <li>Major: Business and Computer Science</li>
                    <li>Year in School: Junior</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <br>

            <li><strong>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</strong>
                <ul type = "a">
                    <li>I'm originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, and I'm studying Business and Computer Science at WashU. 
                        I've worked on projects that sit at the intersection of tech and human-centered design.
                        I took this class because I want a stronger foundation in designing for screens that makes them clear, usable, and visually intentional.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <br>

            <li><strong>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</strong>
                <ul type = "a">
                    <li>I have some experience working with HTML/CSS/JS in a few class and personal projects, mostly to build simple multi-page sites and interactive components. 
                        I also have a bit of experience with modern web development tools and frameworks (like React) and have built basic full-stack projects.
                        I'm comfortable with the basics, but I want to improve my website design so my pages feel more polished and communicate information effectively.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <br>

            <li><strong>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</strong>
                <ul type = "a">
                    <li>I want to learn how to translate design principles into actual screen layouts—especially how to structure content and create interfaces that feel clean and easy to read.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <br>
            
            <li><strong>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</strong>
                <ul type = "a">
                    <li>I think screen design is a lot more interactive and responsive. 
                        With a screen, users scroll, click, and view content on different screen sizes, so the layout has to adapt and guide attention over time. 
                        On the other hand, paper design is fixed and viewed all at once.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <br>

            <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href = "https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo's Website</a></li>
                    <li>Duolingo has a very clear and cohesive brand identity, using strong contrast in color, typography, and text size to create a clear visual hierarchy.
                        "Duolingo Green" is recognizable and consistent across the site, making the brand feel friendly and approachable. 
                        Furthermore, the layout makes information easy to scan, and subtle animations make the content engaging and enjoyable to scroll through without feeling distracting.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <br>

            <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</strong>
                <ul type = "a">
                    <li> <a href = "https://www.apple.com/">Apple's Website</a></li>
                    <li>Apple is very strategic about which products it presents first on its homepage and carefully controls the order in which information is communicated.
                    The site highlights the newest and most relevant releases to drive attention and demand. 
                    The design is highly visual and product-focused, relying primarily on imagery to showcase features. This makes it clear that Apple is selling products rather than emphasizing a broader mission.</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <br>

            <li><strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong>
                <ul type = "a">
                    <li><a href = "https://www.canva.com/">Canva's Website</a></li>
                    <li>Canva is highly feature-oriented, with a personalized homepage that immediately displays a user’s ongoing designs, which reinforces that the product is user-centric software.
                    The interface is highly intuitive, which reduces the learning curve for both new and returning users.
                    Canva also proactively suggests commonly used templates and design formats, helping users get started quickly without feeling overwhelmed.</li>
